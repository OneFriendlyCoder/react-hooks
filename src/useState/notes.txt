* Since we have declared the state variable as a const, we can't directly change it we will need the defined function to change the value of the state variable
ex: [counter, setCounter] = useState();

* When we refresh the page the state variable values are set to the original value.
ex: [counter, setCounter] = useState(0); => whenever the page is refreshed the counter gets the value 0

* useState : lets us add a state variable to our component
syntax: const[state, setState] = useState(initialState);

* once the state is changed the webpage will itself rerender to accomodate the change
